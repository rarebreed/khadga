# Frontend Navbar

First, let's start off with a very basic webpage.  Our end goal with this app is not to create
something beautiful, but simply as a way to get data from some agent (a human, being, an IoT
sensor, or another remote service for example) so that we can work on this data in real time.

Our initial goal is to provide a user interface for a human user (or some AI agent) to post
messages similiar to slack.  It's sort of half slack/gitter, half webchat in that the messages
should be persistenet and editable, but they should also be seen in a public forum (or privately).

A second goal is to provide video camera access to allow for video using WebRTC.

The SPA running on the users browser has 2 initial services:

- Collect messages from an agent and do text classification on it
- Perform face recognition and eye tracking

The very first thing we need to do is create a navigation bar
